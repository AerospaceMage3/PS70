      <h3 style={{ color: 'white' }}>This week I built this website during a very eye-opening vibe coding
        session (Claude 4.5 is amazingly powerful) and thought up the following ideas for my final project:</h3>
      <h3>Final Project Ideas</h3> 
      <ul>
        <li>Arcade Machine - I'd like to combine my interest and experience in programming and game design
            with physical elements by building a gaming system "from scratch." I think this project is a 
            good idea because it allows for a good deal of optionality in terms of difficultly. For example
            I could use an advanced microcontroller and replicate Pong in python, or I restrict my
            available processing/memory and design my own game with limited computing resources. The difficultly
            in terms of the physical elements could also scale by, for example, building a large desk terminal
            or by trying to make the system as small and portable as possible. This is definitely the idea I'm
            most interested in.
        </li>
        <li>Drink Mixing Machine - I'd like to make a Keurig-like machine that lets the user select from a list of possible
            beverages and automatically dispense the according mixture of drinks. The major challenge with this would be
            learning how do control various different pumps and fluid pressures to keep the mixture as exact as possible.
        </li>
        <li>Handwriting Machine - In middle school, I had this idea of for a machine that could transcribe text onto
            piece of paper using a pen whilst imitating my own Handwriting style. This would be an extension on the
            common writing machine, though requiring a bit of extra precision and a good deal of software-work in order
            effectively convert text into my handwriting.
